# Circulate-the-values-of-N-variables
## Aim:
To write a python program to circulate the n variables using function concept
## Equipmentâ€™s required:
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm: 
### Step 1: Initalsie a list 
### Step 2: Assing the values of a variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: Get the value of the user from the number of rotation
Get the value from the user for the number of rotation
### Step 4: Using the slicing concept rotate the list
### Step 5: Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: End the program

## Program:
